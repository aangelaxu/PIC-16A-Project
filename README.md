PIC 16A Final Project: Variable Tic Tac Toe Game with Basic AI

Group Members: Angela Xu and Angus Wu

Description:
  In this project, we created a simple tic-tac-toe game with adjustable dimensions and win conditions for two players, or one player. This game will keep track of the players and note the victory at the end. And, if there is a single player, there is a basic AI function that will play randomly against the human player. The Board class technically will support 2 computer players, but the Game class will not allow a Board with 2 computer players to be created. 
  
To install the package requirements:
  To install the random package, use import random
  
Description of demo file:
  The demo file first imports all the necessary .py files and packages to run the game. The demo file also contains a mainFunction(), that when ran, will initiate the game and prompt the user for the correct information and inputs to create the grid and rest of the game. 3 other code cells in the Demo File create Board objects directly by bypassing the Game class. One creates a game with 2 human players, one creates a game with 1 human player, and one creates a game with 2 computer players. All 3 are created with a board that is 5 by 5 and connect 3 to win. 

Scope and limitations:
  We anticpate no ethical implications from this game. This game relies on command lines, and is not accessible to those who are visually impaired. We originally intended on including an intelligent AI within our game, but could not get it to work within the time that we were given, so this could be an area of future expansion/extension.
